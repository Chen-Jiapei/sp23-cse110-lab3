                            In the last meeting, we discussed about adding four new characters into the storyline we've been working 
                            on: Santana, Wammu, Esidisi, and Kars. Each member will report their current progress on their part and 
                            we will discuss some problems about these characters reported since the last meeting and decide how to 
                            deal with them.

                        Brainstorming About Ability Design of New Characters
                        <p>
                            In this meeting, we will focus on the ability design of the four new characters. So far, if everything goes 
                            on smoothing, we should be about to complete the artistic design, the background story, and corresponding 
                            storyline modification of the new four characters. We will brainstorming about the ability design of the characters 
                            based on the background story.

                        <p>
                            If we are able to come up with good ability design based on the criteria of loyal to the background story and 
                            consensus of everyone in the team, we will designate work on the completion of ability design and implementation 
                            of abilities in the game.

                            Design Department: We will need to modify some of the scenes in the past storylines based on the background 
                            of the four new characters. We have listed all the scenes we need to modify and we should discuss about this 
                            on the next meeting.
